# Pitchers-Analysis

A Python analyzer of baseball data. Runs a singular value decomposition on a set of players (in this case from 2010) using their O-Swing%, Z-Swing%, O-Contact%, and Z-Contact% to determine player likeness. Uses the principal components of each player to find the four statistically closest players to them. Results shown in pandas dataframes
